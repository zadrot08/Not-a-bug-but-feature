# Not-a-bug-but-feature
This game, I immediately warn with bugs. But, as one great sage said, not a bug but a feature. There are 5 types of sprites in the game: ufo (enemy), rocket (player), asteroid (well, what is not clear here), and two types of bonus (plus - shoots triple bullets. minus - I was too lazy to prescribe it, so there is no function there. sorry) by pressing the space bar you launch a torpedo 150 cm 45 mm SUO354. don't waste your bullets, because the bullets also have a reload. Astreoids are impossible to shoot down. There are also admin cheats in the game, are you interested? when you move left to right arrows, you just move, but if you hold down the shift, you will move faster. As a matter of fact, the game is made for weak Nokia, where CS:GO does not pull.
